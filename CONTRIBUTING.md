 - Any unassigned issues are open for the taking.
 - If you'd like to work on something, please assign it to your self so other contributors know you're working on it
 - Be courteous of others. We're all learning and are all on different levels. Help each other out and don't put anyone down for making mistakes. Offer to help if you see someone not doing something right.

# Your First Contribution
Where to begin? Check out any open issues that are not assigned to anyone. These are free for the taking. Pick one that you may be able to help with and assign it to yourself.

Branch off of Develop and create a new branch with a name relevant to the feature you're working on.

Once your work is ready, open a pull request against develop and have it reviewed. Once it's reviewed, it'll be merged into develop.
