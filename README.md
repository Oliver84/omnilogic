# Omnilogic
Omnilogic integration for Home Assistant

An integration that calls the omnilogic_api and gets telemetry data about your pool.

# Setup
While the API is being develop, you'll need to download a local copy of it and put the root directory of this project in a folder called "omnilogic_api"

Copy this folder to your ```custom_components``` folder in your homeassistant directory.

Add ```omnilogic:``` to your config file and add your username and password.
